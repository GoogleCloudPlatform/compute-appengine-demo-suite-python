* Start the map when a minimal number of servers are up.
* Better map zooming - currently, the left map controls both maps. Both maps
  should have the same control.

  program/params and have something in guest quit and be restarted.
* Add a memcached layer for caching tiles
* Pound on the thing with apache bench
* Run the 16 servers across 2 zones.
* Put some buttons to jump to points of interest.
* Add the ability to add/remove instances dynamically
* Provide a way to reset counters/stats.
* Improve visual demarcation of 1 vs. many servers.
* Fix throttled image map to abandon unloaded images when they aren't needed.
